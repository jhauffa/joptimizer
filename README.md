Temporary fork of [vincentk's JOptimizer](https://github.com/vincentk/joptimizer), which
in turn is a fork of JOptimizer 3.4.0.

I am keeping this Git repository around to act as a Maven repository for my modified
version of JOptimizer, until my patches are (hopefully) accepted upstream. Please do not
depend on this repository, as it might go away at any time.
